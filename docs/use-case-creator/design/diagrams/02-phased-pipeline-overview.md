# Diagram 02: Phased Pipeline Overview

Renders in VS Code with the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension, or on GitHub.

## 2a. Full lifecycle

Shows the handler pre-step (chain resolution), the 12-phase sequential routing pipeline that accumulates state into `RoutingContext`, and the FR-COMMIT-01 safety-net that fires later at `POST /commit-changes`.

> **Note:** The RoutingEngine reads `data_link`/`control_link` normally via repositories. The pipeline has NO `resolvedChains` field — chain resolution writes STAGED link edit_actions directly; that result is never threaded through RoutingContext.

## 2b. Phase applicability by mode

Compares which of the 12 pipeline phases execute in Auto mode (`create-usecases`) versus Manual mode (`create-manual-usecases`), highlighting phases that are skipped or run with different logic in Manual mode.

## Legend

- Yellow band / node: upstream module (subsystem-links) involvement, or phase runs with mode-specific logic
- Green band / node: routing pipeline phase runs normally (darker green = Half A pre-routing; standard green = Half B routing; lighter green = Half C validate + emit)
- Gray node: phase skipped in this mode
- Purple band: commit-time safety net (runs separately at `POST /commit-changes`, not inside the routing pipeline)
- Red terminal: blocking error path (transaction rolled back)
- Green terminal: success path (HTTP 200 returned)

## Notes

The routing pipeline is strictly sequential and is organized into three explicit halves. Half A ("Resolve fate of existing UCs") runs first as intentional pre-routing checks: PreValidationService guards inputs, DeletionScopeService detects impacted UCs and fail-fasts on FR-DEL-02 (an unselected UC would be impacted), and DisconnectedTransitionSvc handles status transitions — all before any new UC production begins. Half B ("Produce new UCs from input GKVs") performs routing proper: KV resolution, seed and cone computation, DFS traversal, combination expansion, and classification. A blocking error at the end of Half B causes an immediate `Result.fail` return and a full transaction rollback; Half C does not execute. Half C ("Validate + emit") runs only on the clean path: orphan validation, staging edit_actions via `IUsecaseRepository`, and response construction. Each of the 12 phases reads from and writes to a shared `RoutingContext` object, but individual service implementations are stateless — all mutable state lives in `RoutingContext` and the surrounding unit-of-work. The FR-COMMIT-01 safety-net (direction correction, path re-validation, orphan detection) is intentionally separate from the routing pipeline — it runs minutes or hours later when the user explicitly triggers `POST /commit-changes`, providing a final guard before pending changes are persisted. In Manual mode, phases 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are bypassed because the caller supplies SG identifiers directly and pair discovery is performed via a targeted DB query (FR-UC-01) rather than graph traversal; phase 9 runs in partial mode (idempotency check only). For projects without subsystems (the common case), the chain resolver is a fast no-op — the routing engine has no coupling to that feature.
